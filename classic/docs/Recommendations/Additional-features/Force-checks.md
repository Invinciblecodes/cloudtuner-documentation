## Force check and check time

At the moment, a check-up is performed every 3 hours and the results are reflected in the Recommendations hub, which is accessible via the left sidebar of the main page. A user with the Organization manager role can initialize a **Force check** that will immediately run the Data Sources' evaluation sequence.

Alternatively, find the last and next check time in the Summary Cards.
