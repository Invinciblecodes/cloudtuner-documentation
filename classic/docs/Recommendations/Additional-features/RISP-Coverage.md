## RI/SP Coverage

An **RI/SP Coverage** page is designed to help monitor and enhance **AWS Reserved Instances (RI)** and **AWS Savings Plans (SP)** utilization. Utilizing the insights from this page can lead to substantial cost reductions — sometimes up to 72% — by aligning cloud resource commitments with actual usage patterns.

Explore the **RI/SP Coverage** page to start optimizing cloud expenditures effectively: go to the **Recommendations** section → click the card in the **Summary cards** section.

## Summary cards

Go to the **Recommendations** section of the menu and view the card in the **Summary cards** section.

It shows the `amount of money saved with commitments for the last 30 days` and the `percentage of computed expenses covered with commitments`.

The card is clickable and leads you to the **RI/SP Coverage** page.

## Page overview

The page **RI/SP coverage** shows two breakdowns by usage and expenses. Filter data output by data sources and/or date range. Hover the cursor over the data column of the chart, and detailed information appears.

The **Usage** breakdown shows the compute percentage covered by RI/SP. Uncovered usage highlights areas where purchasing more RI or SP could reduce costs.

The **Expenses** breakdown shows the amount of compute covered by RI/SP. Turn on **Show Savings** to see cost savings compared to projected expenses without RI/SP. Uncovered expenses indicate areas where increased RI or SP adoption could lower costs.
