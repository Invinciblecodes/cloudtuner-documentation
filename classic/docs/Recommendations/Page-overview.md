### Color schema

Pay special attention to the color schema of the page.

A color indicates a critical situation, signaling that you should focus on the card and its information.

A color signifies that there are no recommendations or that potential savings are zero.

A color appears when there are items requiring attention.

In all other situations, the card is white.

### How to use recommendation cards in Cloud tuner ?
 
 
Recommendation cards are typically user interface elements that provide personalized suggestions to users based on their behavior, preferences, or other relevant data. These cards are commonly seen in various digital environments, such as e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and content websites. The purpose of recommendation cards is to enhance user experience, increase engagement, and drive conversion rates by suggesting products, services, or content that users will likely find appealing.

The Cloudtuner team created a particular page with cards for your convenience. The cards are designed to be visually appealing and catch your eye. They usually include a brief description and other pertinent information to help you assess the situation quickly.

The most straightforward interaction is clicking or tapping on a card, which leads to more detailed information about the recommended item.

All cards have the same structure. Let's look at the structure of the card using 'Obsolete Images' as an example:

![card_structure](https://cloudtuner-email-templates-image.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/documentation/cardstructurerecommendations.png)

Name, applicable services, description, and total possible savings (or total count of items) are to inform you. A list of items with maximum savings, a list of all items, and actions are clickable.

Click the item in the list with maximum savings to view detailed information. To view all items, click the See all items link.

The 'Actions' menu differs depending on the card. Download a cleanup script or a JSON/XLSX file with a list of recommendations. Each recommendation can be pinned to the top of the list (max is 5). Recommendations are configurable. Open a menu by clicking the ellipsis. Each menu item has a tooltip; use it to get detailed information.

### Download script

Use to download the script for a specific data source and run it against a downloaded JSON file with the recommendation data.

The option is not available for all cards.

### Download JSON/XLSX file

Use to download the list of items in the json/xlsx format.

The option is not available for all cards.

### Settings

Adjusting parameters is beneficial as it allows for fine-tuning and optimizing results to better meet specific goals or conditions. The set of parameters varies depending on the card, so set the values according to your needs.

Note

New settings will be applied on the next recommendations check.
