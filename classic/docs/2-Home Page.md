For convenience, a button for going to the main page of the section is implemented. Use it to get more detailed information.

In most tables presented in the sections, the rows are clickable, which allows to get quick access to the information about an item.

The page is divided into 7 sections:

- *Organization expenses*. See the total expenses of the previous month, the expenses of the current month, and this month forecast. A red line on the chart shows the expenses limit.
